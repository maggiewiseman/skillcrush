            <h2>A little about me</h2>
            <div class="half-width">
              <p>My journey into tech started with a degree in chemistry from Harvey Mudd College.  I was recruited by a big five consulting firm, was quickly trained in Java and a middleware called Vitria.  After spending a year customizing an implementation I realized I needed to work in a sector that I was passionate about - education. </p>

            <div class="half-width">
              <p>When I became a teacher I took my tech skills with me. I created and hosted a website for my students - a place where they could find notes, assignments, resources and eventually lecture videos. Technology has the potential to revolutionize a students' educational experience for the better and I am passtionate about utilizing my pedegogical knowledge to create web applications that both inspire and make learning more accessible for all. </p>
